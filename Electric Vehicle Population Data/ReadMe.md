# 🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis of Electric Vehicle Population

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the adoption and distribution of electric vehicles (EVs) using real-world data. The goal is to uncover insights into EV growth trends, popular vehicle models, geographic distribution, and other key factors influencing EV adoption.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about registered electric vehicles, including:

- Make & Model of EVs
- Year of Manufacture
- Electric Range (in miles)
- Vehicle Type (BEV, PHEV, etc.)
- Charging Capabilities
- Geographical Location (State/City/ZIP Code)

## Raw Data
- [Raw Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratikkakkar/electric-vehicle-population-data)
  
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and analysis
- Power BI for interactive dashboard creation
- Excel for preliminary data exploration

## 📊 Analysis Approach
- **Data Cleaning:**
    - Handling missing values
    - Duplicate records
    - Data type conversions
      
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Distribution of EVs by brand & model
    - Growth trends of EV adoption over the years
    - Popular EV types (BEV vs. PHEV)
    - Geographical analysis of EV registrations
    - Battery range analysis and its impact on adoption
      
- **Data Visualization:** Using Power BI to create interactive reports and dashboards

## 🔍 Key Findings (To be updated)
Initial insights will be added as the analysis progresses.
